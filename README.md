# Example Python Project

[![Test](https://github.com/nznobody/example-python/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nznobody/example-python/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This demonstrates the process documented on [PFR's Confluence](https://plantandfood.atlassian.net/l/c/4w05hCVm)

## Summary

* Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage project, build, and dependencies
* Use [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run tests
* Use [Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai) to generate version strings
* Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to enforce a simple style
* Use Github Actions to ensure stable development by enforcing all the above.

> This requires poetry to be installed on your system (not just your virtual environment)!
